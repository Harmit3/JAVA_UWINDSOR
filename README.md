CLI-Based Banking System
Project Description: Develop a console application for managing a banking system that allows customers to open accounts, perform transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers), manage account information, and view account balances. The system will also provide administrative functionalities for bank staff, such as account monitoring and report generation.
